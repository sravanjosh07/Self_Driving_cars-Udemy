## MNIST ##
* Obtained the data of 70,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels containing digits from 0 to 9 from google API (MNIST dataset)
* Developed a dense layer model that classifies the digits. with an accuracy of 94, and an impressive test score of 9.2/10.



## Road Sign Classification ##

* The data of 58,000 RGB images of German traffic signs with 32x32x3 pixels is collected from bitbucket (Open Source).
* Developed a CNN model that could classify the images and recognize the traffic sign using multi-layer Convolution.
* This project was implemented using Keras, Scikitlearn, Pandas, and Python.


## Road Lane Detecttion ##

* Developed a model to detect lanes on the image of a road using the Hough Transform technique. 
* The model is then integrated on a short video of the highway, and it could successfully detect the lanes.

## Basic Regressoin, Multiclass classification ##
